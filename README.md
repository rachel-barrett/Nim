This  is a GUI implementation of the mathematical strategy game [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim), written in python using the pygame module. 

You play against the computer, taking it in turns to remove as many counters as you like from one column only; the aim is to take the last counter.

For instructions on how to run this program see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)

** Currently the functionality allowing you to decide whether you would like to go first or second is not working as it fails in certain environments so has been disabled.
